Project Description - 
The purpose of this Car Rental Web application is to minimize the hassle users had to face in order for them to hire or rent a car. 
Users normally have to call a certain rental serivce to check whether their preferred vehicle is available or not. But with this car system, 
users don't have that problem. They can easily book a vehicle of their chocie from our web site according to their requirements such as vehicle 
type, package and the number of days they need the vehilce. They can reserve their vehicle and confirm the reservation by making the payment 
through the web application.
